   <p style="border: 2px solid gold; padding:50px;">
     During his life Weiland <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Weiland">Weiland</a> was a donor to more than 60 nonprofit organizations and distributed an estimated $21.5m primarily between 1996–2006. His largest gift was to establish an endowed chair in his mother's name at Stanford - the Martha Meier Weiland professorship in the School of Medicine. He was influential as an active member of the Northwest gay community. During his time as a volunteer on the Pride Foundation's board of directors from 1997 to 2001, he helped win the fight to get General Electric to include sexual orientation in their non-discrimination policy. A member of the national GLSEN board (an organization focused on supporting gay-straight alliances in schools across the country) from 2002–2005, he was a fervent supporter of programs promoting safe schools for all kids.

<p id= "volunteer-info" class="accent"> The permanent endowment funds established through Weiland's estate have a 2017 value of more than $150m and generate approximately $7.5m per year in program support. As the investment returns on these funds compound, Weiland's impact, especially in support of students will continue to grow. </p>
